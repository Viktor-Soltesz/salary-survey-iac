# metrics__semantic_kpis.yml
# This file defines semantic metrics for analysis and dashboarding.
# These are not used in dbt Core builds, but represent a centralized definition
# of business metrics such as average and median normalized salary.
# Intended for compatibility with dbt Cloud's Semantic Layer or MetricFlow in the future.
