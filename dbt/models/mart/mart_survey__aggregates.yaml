  - name: mart_survey__aggregates
    description: |
      This model provides aggregated salary statistics derived from the cleaned, normalized, and outlier-flagged survey data.
      It groups the data by key demographic and job-related attributes such as country, year, seniority level, job category, and company size.
      The resulting aggregates, including median, average, percentiles, and standard deviation, are designed to support
      high-level dashboarding, trend analysis, and comparative studies of developer salaries across different segments.
      Outliers are excluded from these calculations to provide a more representative view of typical salary ranges.

          The number of individual survey entries that fall into this specific
          combination of grouping attributes (country, year, seniority, job category, company size)
          after filtering out outliers. This represents the sample size for the aggregate measures.
          Groups are only included if this count is greater than 20.

      # Measures of central tendency
      - name: median_salary_norm
        description: |
          The median annual salary for this group, normalized by both the country's
          inflation factor (relative to a base year, e.g., 2024) and a measure of
          economic purchasing power like GDP per capita (PPP). This aims to provide
          a more comparable salary figure across different countries and years.

          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0" # Median can be 0 if all entries in a small group are 0 after normalization


      - name: median_salary_2024
        description: |
          The median annual salary for this group, adjusted only for inflation
          to a common base year (e.g., 2024). This helps in comparing salaries
          over time within the same country or across countries without accounting
          for differences in economic output or cost of living beyond inflation.
        data_type: NUMERIC
        tests:

      - name: median_salary_gdp
        description: |
          The median annual salary for this group, normalized by a country's
          economic output measure such as GDP per capita (PPP). This can indicate
          salary relative to the local economic context.
        data_type: NUMERIC

      - name: avg_salary_norm
        description: |
          The mean (average) annual salary for this group, normalized by both
          inflation (relative to 2024) and GDP per capita (PPP).
        data_type: NUMERIC
        tests:
          - not_null

        description: |
          The mean (average) annual salary for this group, adjusted only for
          inflation to a common base year (2024).
        data_type: NUMERIC
        tests:

      - name: avg_salary_gdp
        description: |
          The mean (average) annual salary for this group, normalized by GDP
          per capita (PPP).

      # Measures of spread
      - name: p25_salary_norm
        description: |
          The 25th percentile (first quartile) of the normalized salary
          (inflation and GDP adjusted) for this group. This indicates the value
          below which 25% of the salaries fall.
        data_type: NUMERIC
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0"


      - name: p75_salary_norm
        description: |
          The 75th percentile (third quartile) of the normalized salary
          (inflation and GDP adjusted) for this group. This indicates the value
          below which 75% of the salaries fall.
        data_type: NUMERIC
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0"
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true: # P75 should be >= P25
              expression: ">= p25_salary_norm"


      - name: stddev_salary_norm
        description: |
          The standard deviation of the normalized salary (inflation and GDP adjusted)
          for this group. A measure of the dispersion or spread of salaries around the mean.
          Higher values indicate greater variability in salaries within the group.
        data_type: FLOAT64 # Standard deviation usually results in a float
        tests:
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0"


      - name: iqr_salary_norm
        description: |
          The Interquartile Range (IQR) of the normalized salary (inflation and GDP adjusted)
          for this group. Calculated as the difference between the 75th percentile (P75)
          and the 25th percentile (P25). It represents the range containing the middle 50%
          of the salary data and is a robust measure of spread, less affected by outliers
          than standard deviation.
        data_type: NUMERIC # Difference between two NUMERICs
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0"

      - name: skewness_indicator
        description: |
          A simple indicator of the skewness of the normalized salary distribution
          for this group, calculated as the difference between the mean and the median
          (avg_salary_norm - median_salary_norm).
          A positive value suggests the distribution is right-skewed (tail extends to higher values, mean > median),
          while a negative value suggests it is left-skewed (tail extends to lower values, mean < median).
          A value close to zero suggests a roughly symmetrical distribution.
        data_type: NUMERIC # Difference between two NUMERICs
        tests:
          - not_null # Can be zero or negative, so no >= 0 test needed here
