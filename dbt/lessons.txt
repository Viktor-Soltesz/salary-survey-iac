PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'dbt_packages\\dbt-utils-1.3.0\\integration_tests'

IDE extensions often watch the file system for changes within the project directory to provide features like auto-completion, error highlighting, and dependency analysis.

Configure VS Code File Watching: You can tell VS Code to ignore the dbt_packages directory.
Go to File -> Preferences -> Settings (or Ctrl+,).
Search for files.watcherExclude.
Click "Add Pattern".
Add the pattern **/dbt_packages/**.
You might also want to add **/target/**.
Restart VS Code after making these changes. This often prevents the file watcher from locking files during dbt operations.
